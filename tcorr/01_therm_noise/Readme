Smooth fits of noise thermometry data for all cooldowns.

get_data -- script for getting data from the database

fit_temp.m -- matlab script reads thermometry file and file with kinks,
  makes piecewise fit.

put_data -- put smoothed data to the database



---------------------------------------------

If temperature of the nuclear stage is
$Tns = Tns0 + a t$ , temperature of He3 is $The$,
and thermalization time is $tau$ then

dThe/dt = - (The - Tns)/tau

Looking for the solution in the form
The = A*exp(-t/tau) + a*t + C:

-A exp(-t/tau) + a*tau = - (A exp(-t/tau) + a t + C - Tns0 - a t)

C = Tns0 - a*tau
A = The0-Tns0 + a*tau

The = (The0 - Tns0 + a*tau) * exp(-t/tau) + Tns0 + a*(t-tau)
